# asan_login_flutter

`ASAN Login` package for Flutter. The main responsibility of the package, as it is sufficient for mobile-side of the projects, is to extract `token` once the user is successfully logged in. The extracted `token`'s payload contains logged user's basic information. For advanced validation of user, please refer to `ASAN Login`'s documentation provided to your institution.

</h2>

### packageName

The `packageName` under which your project is registered on `ASAN Login` system. Make sure to use same String for your app's both `applicationId` on Android side and `CFBundleIdentifier` on iOS side to avoid any side effects.

### progressColor

### clearCookies

When `clearCookies` is set to `true` user stays as logged in if previously logged. When set to `false` (which is recommended to use as a configuration for most of the use cases of `ASAN Login`) user gets redirected to the login page of `ASAN Login` everytime.

### environment

### onLogin

Called when user successfully logs in, with `token` (`String`);

## Clearing cache

When user's session is terminated on the app (~logout), make sure to call clearAsanLoginCache() global method to make sure user's previous `ASAN Login` cache is cleared from app's cache.
