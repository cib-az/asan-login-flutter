`ASAN Login` plugin-package for Flutter. The main responsibility of the package, as it is sufficient for mobile-side of the projects, is to extract `token` once the user is successfully logged in. The extracted `token`'s payload contains logged user's basic information. For advanced validation of user, please refer to `ASAN Login`'s documentation provided to you.

      mobileKeyIos: 'com.example.example',
      environment: AsanLoginEnvironment.preProd,
      clearCookies: true,
    ),
    loadingWidgetBuilder: (double progress) {
      return Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 80.0),
        child: LinearProgressIndicator(
          value: progress / 100,
        ),

#### mobileKeyAndroid, mobileKeyIos

The mobile key under which your project is registered on `ASAN Login`. Make sure to use same `String` for your app's both `applicationId` on Android side and `CFBundleIdentifier` on iOS side to avoid any side effects.

#### loadingWidgetBuilder

A builder parameter for customizing loading animation, which is mainly visible until full loading of `ASAN Login` web page.

#### clearCookies

When `clearCookies` is set to `true` user stays as logged in if previously logged. When set to `false` (which is recommended to use as a configuration for most of the use cases of `ASAN Login`) user gets redirected to the login page of `ASAN Login` everytime.

#### environment

Defines environment for `ASAN Login`. For more info about the enivironments and their behaviors check documentation provided to you by `ASAN Login`

#### onLogin

Called when user successfully logs in, with `token` (`String`); 

### Clearing cache

When user's session is terminated on the app (~logout), make sure to call clearAsanLoginCache() global method to make sure user's previous `ASAN Login` cache is cleared from app's cache.
